# k0s_cluster (Resource)

Manages a k0s cluster.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "k0s_cluster" "example" {
  name    = "example"
  version = "1.27.2+k0s.0"

  hosts = [
    {
      role = "controller+worker"

      ssh = {
        address  = "10.0.0.1"
        port     = 22
        user     = "root"
        key_path = "~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub"
      }
    },
    {
      role = "worker"

      ssh = {
        address  = "10.0.0.2"
        port     = 22
        user     = "root"

## Schema

### Required

- `hosts` (Attributes Set) Hosts configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--hosts))
- `name` (String) Name of the cluster.
- `version` (String) Desired k0s version.

### Optional

- `concurrency` (Number) Maximum number of hosts to configure in parallel. If omitted, the default value is `0` (unlimited).
- `config` (String) Embedded k0s cluster configuration. When left out, the output of `k0s config create` will be used.
- `dynamic_config` (Boolean) Enable k0s dynamic config.
- `no_drain` (Boolean) Do not drain worker nodes when upgrading. If omitted, the default value is `false`.
- `no_wait` (Boolean) Do not wait for worker nodes to join. If omitted, the default value is `false`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique ID of the cluster.
- `kubeconfig` (String, Sensitive) Admin kubeconfig of the cluster.

### Nested Schema for `hosts`

Required:

- `role` (String) Role of the host. One of `controller`, `controller+worker`, `single`, `worker`.
- `ssh` (Attributes) SSH connection options. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--hosts--ssh))

Optional:

- `environment` (Map of String) List of key-value pairs to set to the target host's environment variables.
- `hostname` (String) Override host's hostname. When not set, the hostname reported by the operating system is used.
- `install_flags` (List of String) Extra flags passed to the `k0s install` command on the target host.
- `no_taints` (Boolean) When `true` and used in conjuction with the `controller+worker` role, the default taints are disabled making regular workloads schedulable on the node. By default, k0s sets a `node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule` taint on `controller+worker` nodes and only workloads with toleration for it will be scheduled.
- `os` (String) Override OS distribution auto-detection.
- `private_address` (String) Override private IP address selected by host fact gathering.
- `private_interface` (String) Override private network interface selected by host fact gathering. Useful in case fact gathering picks the wrong private network interface.

Required:

- `address` (String) IP address of the host.
- `port` (Number) TCP port of the SSH service on the host.
